#README##Reddit Comment BotThis repository contains an example script of the most basic type of reddit comment bot. It uses python, and the "praw" library, which is specifically made for Reddit/Python interaction. ##InstallationIn order to use this script you will need to have the latest version of python installed, and have praw installed as well. If you need to install the latest version of **python** you can follow the instructions from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and if you need to download the **praw** library, which you need to interact with reddit and make your own app you can follow the direction from this [link](https://chatbotslife.com/how-to-build-a-reddit-bot-c890efb330c1). ##Usage In the code, the cID is your personal use script, and your cSC is your secret. Both of these are codes given to you by reddit when you register a new app with them. The script here will not work on it's own. You must have other files from Reddit in the same folder as your python script, which allows your bot to interact with reddit. All of this is also explained on the website linked above.
